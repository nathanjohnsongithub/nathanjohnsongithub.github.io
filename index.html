                        I just love the photo of you and it was one of the earlier times you slept over. I had a wonderful time as always and I thought you looked magical as ever with the sunrise. Crazy we used to wakeup and see sunrises like that without it being cold as balls, it will be back soon enough.

                        Nothing super specific about this photo more about the night overall (except for you ordering mcdonalds (huge)). Something about this night though is we had a fight? / miscommunication / I fucked up. And I'm not gonna lie i was crashing TF out in the backyard with my roommates and then i poured my heart out to you because I genuinely thought i fucked up on something i cared about so much which is why I was so damn emotional. Thankfully you were amazing about everything and it worked out :)

                        This was such an amazing time because we got to go out and drink together! For the first time. We also got to dance and just have a good time and live, we also got photobooth pictures (we need some more). It was a really enjoyable night for me because I love seeing you be social, which you were at the pregame, and just spending time and enjoying life with you is so precious to me, which is why this was such a stunning night (among 1000% other reasons)

                        This was genuinely, swear to god, on asian, on of my favorite moments with you, the picture behind this text. Truthfully everything about the day was perfect, I got to keep learning more about you, and this moment just has such a special place in my heart. I'm not sure if it was the music, or the view, or you laying on my chest, or the loud ass train that was going for 87% of the time. Whatever it was, I loved every moment of it.

                        I just included this picture because I 1. think its cute and 2. it shows that you're not always serious and you an joke around with me which is something that I love so much about you 💗 This was also the day I got back from the dells which is funny because I already missed you so much in just the short time we we're apart for that weekend, and now look at us... but its exciting and I know we will be back together before we both know it.

                        Holy Hannah Remy photo!!!! my two favorite girls in the whole entire world together! What more could a guy want in his life. This was the last time that you got to see Remy and what's funny to me is how much she loves you, I think it shows that you're such a welcoming person to be around that Remy instantly loves you so much, and I would say Remy loves me a lot and she did not give a shit about me when you we're in the room. I think it says a lot about my lovely girlfriend :))

                        Obviously I love this photo because we both look amazing, but it was also something that we both posted that was so upfront about the relationship and I loved it. Besides that I was being a debby downer that night but I think I picked it up later on, overall I'm incredibly happy I went and that I got to meet (most) of your friend!!

                        I don't have a ton to say about this photo, I just really like it. One thing I don't feel like I tell you enough is that you're very serious about the gym, and I'm really attracted to this because 1. it shows you car about yourself and that you have some work-ethic (which you have 100000%), but its also just something that is big into my life so its great we can bound over it. It's also fun making you splits and talking with you about things so thats also why I put this photo in here.
