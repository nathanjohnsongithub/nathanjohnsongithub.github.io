            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! YOU COMPLETED THE SCAVENGER HUNT!!!!!! WOOT WOOT!!!!!!!!!!!! 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                So you asked me to write you an email, and I somehow popped this out of myself, and its now 1:00am, and I'm finally finishing it up. The fact that I got so much enjoyment out of 
                making this for you tells me all I need to know about my love for you, and I hope it does the same to you. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                This won't be the most magical note you've ever seen, but it had a scavenger hunt at the start so who gives a fuck. I will give some short things before I pass the fuck out. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                I imagine you wanted me to write an email to you so that you would feel more connected to me, more reassured, and even more in love with me. I hope and pray that this cute little game not only gave you some reassurance, 
                but also removed stress from you for even a little moment. If it did either of those things, I will be overjoyed. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                Now, I can't lie, this long-distance BS is starting to get really old HOWEVER, at least I get to do things like this to attempt to cheer you up while you're down, especially because I can't physically be there to help. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                But even though the long-distance is getting old, it doesn't mean my love for you is shrinking, It's quite the opposite actually. A prime example of this is how much more open we've gotten
                with each other through the distance, Like were fully talking about living together, you made AI kids, and its 10000% more than we we're doing when I left.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                This increased comfort, and overall increase in love is why I know you're special. How many people can really say they've gotten closer during long distance? It's truly such a blessing that we can
                (and should) acknowledge.      
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                This overall increase in love makes me super excited for the future. We will finally be done with the distance. I now love you even more than before. It will be summer, IN CHICAGO. So so much to look forward, and I want to experience it all with you Hannah.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                Sometimes we're disconnected because of this distance, sometimes its because I'm busy and crashing out, sometimes its because you're busy and crashing out. But, we always support and help each other which is truly what matters.    
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                This support and communication is something I love about you and us, and even if we're disconnected and can't call, text, or hear each others voices; I still know you're my person, I still love your face, I still wonder what you're up to,
                I still wish you were with me, I still hope to come home to your smile one day, I still wish I could stare at the skyline and talk to you for hours, I still; and always will love you. You mean everything to me and more. Please don't forget that Hannah.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                I hope you enjoyed the short scavenger hunt and even shorter note, I'm going to go pass tf out.
