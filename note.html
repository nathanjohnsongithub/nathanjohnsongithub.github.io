            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                Hello Hannah! Actually all I can say is thank you. Thank you for caring about me so much. Thank you for always talking to me
                even when I'm not feeling the best. Thank you for being my person and for always being there for me. And thank you for that 
                perfect presentation of our relationship???? That was amazing and had me tearing up and tweaking in TrueLayer from the 700 different 
                emotions that were going through my system. You are truly the best and I'm so blessed to be with someone as beautiful and thoughtful
                as you are. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                Yesterday was interesting to say the least but I'm so glad we got to talk about everything that we did. I know realize that I have
                been suppressing my feelings and trying to thrive and push past them without actually thinking about why I was feeling the way I did. 
                You finally got me to stop and just think about everything that was happening. I am so so so happy you did because I didn't know I needed 
                it as much as I did. So truly, thank you Hannah. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                To be able to vocalize what I had been feeling when I didn't even know it, was a blessing and I already feel 1000% better today. I now realize
                that all of my stress from job applications, imposter syndrome, the uncomfortability of being abroad are causing me to feel the need to do so much
                work, and this influx of work combined with school, TrueLayer, and just living a functional life caused me to take away from doing things that I
                now realize I need. Things like reading, relaxing, journaling, running and so much more. These are the things that should always be present, because they
                allow for me to work at 100% ability when I'm doing other things like job applications, working out, school, ect. You allowed me to step back and think about this,
                and to allow me to think it through, so I thank you once again. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                With all of that being said, I am still good and I'm not suffering 110% of the time while I'm here, but I realize not that the reason I'm not having as good of a time
                as I want while abroad has to do both with thinks I can and can't control, and I now recognize this. I do wish so things were different, but I still can change the things 
                I have control over and I now know I need to do it. Please know that I will be okay, I just have a lot going on, a lot of stressors, and I am not taking care of myself 
                as well as I should be BUT! This will pass and I will figure things out, and I know you will be there with me the entire time. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                The vlog, email, texts, they're all amazing and I'm so grateful you care so much about me. The vlog helped a lot and I thank you again for it
                and then the slideshow presentation right after was just everything I could need. Sorry for the absurd crash out last night and for not being as 
                chipper, but I'm still so glad I got to talk to you.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                So, once more, thank you Hannah ❤️ Let's move away from the sadness and start talking about how we've been together 
                for 5 months :) 
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                Holy holy holy shit, We've been together for 5 whole months!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You're genuinely such a blessing and I'm so happy that you came into my life.
                I think how lucky I am to be loved by you and I can't believe this love found me. I feel really not well spoken currently but I hope you like this addition to the website??
                It's a supplemental for me not knowing how to type. I'll watch the vlog again and I'll add some comments to that so I can give you some more substance than this sorry ass typing.
                Also, the pictures you were posting on your story to try and get me to notice you??? And you looking for me at concessions???? You're actually the funniest girl ever and it fills my 
                heart so much to think about it :)))) The Canva presentation was absolutely breathtaking and I can't believe you made that for me, so thank you thank you thank you thank you. Every "chapter"
                of our life together has been amazing and that presentation highlights all of it. I also did notice the photo before we had the post gym sex, and I also love the photo from when we 
                went to trader joes??? I had never seen that we look so happy and cute together (pls send). May that bouncing post workout sex reach us again once I'm back in Chicago 🙏🙏 
                The food I thought about was Salmon Nigiri, and I've decided that once I'm back were running to all you can eat sushi to get some. 
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                Anywho, I have so much more I want to tell you about but I'll leave it now. The main thing is thank you for caring about me so much, and thank you for everything you do.
                You mean so much to me and im so happy we're together. The day we reunite will be the greatest day of my life, mark my freaking words.
            </p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 document-text">
                Sorry that this was all over the place, I hope the point got across (basically, you're amazing and I love you and Happy 5 months). I love you so much Hannah, please have a good day and Happy 5 months once again ❤️❤️❤️❤️
